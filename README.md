# Linked-Lists

A linked list is a dynamic data structure comprised of nodes, like elements in an array. Each node contains a value and a reference pointing to the next node in the list. This project is from [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists)
